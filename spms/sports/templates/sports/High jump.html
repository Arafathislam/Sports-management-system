            <p> <b>Description:</b> The high jump isÂ a track and field event in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without dislodging it. In its modern, most-practiced format, a bar is placed between two standards with a crash mat for landing. The player must jump high and score the highest point to win.
